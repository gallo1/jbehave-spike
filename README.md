jbehave-spike
=============

Going to shave a yak and make it JBehave.

Goal
----

In approximate order of priority:

* To learn how to write a JBehave test
* To get the tests running under Maven
* To get the tests _reporting_ under Maven
* To get the tests working with Spring-based dependency injection
* To get the tests working with Spring-based transactionality.
* To get the tests working, under Maven, and using the test compile scope
* To get an in-IDE test runner that shows up scenarios as individual 'JUnit' tests.

My limited (<3 hour) experience with JBehave at the time of starting this quest indicates that some or all of the above may well be damn near impossible.
